It contains a database of expression levels of 20,737 genes represented by 58,692 probes across the complete cortical mantle and is constructed postmortem from the brains of 6 human donors with no history of psychiatric or neuropathological disorders. The donor brains also underwent MRI postmortem and the probe locations mapped into each donor's MRI data in MNI space, providing a great opportunity to correlate regional gene expression with imaging findings! Data is freely available to download from AIBS AIBS . Extracting appropriate gene expression data from the Allen Atlas has many caveats, detailed in the excellent paper here but tools have now been developed to make gene extraction easier. The following list includes software/packages and useful resources that can be used to extract gene expression data in imaging space.","title":"Extracting data from the Allen atlas"},{"location":"53-genetics-software/#abagen","text":"Open-source Python software for extracting gene expression data from the ALlen atlas. repository URL: Github website URL: http://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html tutorial URL: documentation: https://abagen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html programming language: {python} paper DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3726257.","title":"Abagen"},{"location":"53-genetics-software/#matlab-repository-from-aurina-arnatkeviciute","text":"Repository from the Aurina's paper describing best practice when extracting data from the Allen atlas. repository URL: Github programming language: {matlab} paper DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.011 contact: aurina.arnatkeviciute@monash.edu","title":"Matlab repository from Aurina Arnatkeviciute"},{"location":"60-quality-control/","text":"Quality control When processing data, it is considered good practice (and is also very useful!) to inspect the intermediate output files/data created after every few steps.
